# MOOC.fi Java Programming II Course Solutions

This repository includes every solution that I have made to the programming exercises in the MOOC.fi Java Programming II Course.
These solutions were made using the TestMyCode extension on VSCode/VSCodium rather than the recommended NetBeans IDE.
All of these solutions should work in 2022, but the exercises are subject to change and these solutions are not guaranteed to work.
Solutions given from MOOC.fi after submission may not necessarily be the same as the solutions I am providing in this repository.
